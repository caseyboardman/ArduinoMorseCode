# ArduinoMorseCode
Morse Code library for Arduino

Goals for this project:
1. Make a library to output a string of characters as morse code.
2. Build and deploy without the Arduino IDE.  DIY baby!
3. Unit testing, and figure out best way to do it.
 * I'm thinking about rolling my own xUnit framework just for that experience as well.

The real goals are to mess around, learn some new stuff, and have a good time doing coding!
